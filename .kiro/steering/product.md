# Product Overview

## ONI AI Agent

This project develops an AI agent capable of playing Oxygen Not Included (ONI), a complex colony simulation game. The system progresses through five phases: data extraction from save files, environment design, baseline model development, reinforcement learning training, and advanced hierarchical planning with LLM integration.

## Core Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: Create an RL agent that can maintain colony survival by managing oxygen, temperature, resources, and duplicant happiness
- **Research Focus**: Hierarchical planning, multi-scale decision making, and LLM-assisted reasoning for complex strategy games
- **Technical Achievement**: Bridge between traditional game AI and modern deep learning approaches

## Success Metrics

- Colony survival rate across diverse scenarios
- Resource efficiency and sustainability
- Performance comparison against heuristic baselines
- Scalability to larger maps and longer episodes

## Target Users

- ML researchers working on game AI and hierarchical planning
- ONI community interested in AI-assisted gameplay
- Developers building complex decision-making systems
